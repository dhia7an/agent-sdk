# Core Concepts

This page distills the mental model of `@cognipeer/agent-sdk` before you dive into the detailed guides.

## 1. State container
A `SmartState` object flows through the loop. Key fields:
- `messages`: Conversation list (user, assistant, tool, system)
- `toolCallCount`: Aggregate count across the invocation
- `toolHistory` / `toolHistoryArchived`: Raw + summarized tool outputs
- `summaries`: Summarization messages (compressed context)
- `plan` / `planVersion`: Planning/TODO metadata
- `usage`: Aggregated usage (provider‐normalized where possible)
- `agent`: Active runtime metadata (name, tools, limits) – swaps on handoff
- `ctx`: Scratchpad for system internals (structured output flags, event hooks)

## 2. Nodes (phases)
Each node is a pure-ish async function that receives the state and returns deltas:
- **resolver** – normalizes incoming state, seeds counters, wires runtime.
- **agentCore** – invokes the model, optionally binding tools, and appends the assistant response.
- **tools** – executes proposed tool calls (respecting global and per-turn limits).
- **contextSummarize** *(conditional)* – archives heavy tool outputs and writes summaries when token pressure is high.
- **toolLimitFinalize** – injects a system notice when the global tool-call cap is hit.

## 3. Tools

Tools are any object satisfying a minimal contract (`invoke`/`call`/`func`). Use `createSmartTool({ name, schema, func })` for convenience; schemas are Zod and outputs are serialized directly to tool messages.

Guidelines:
- Validate inputs strictly (Zod will throw on invalid args).
- Return concise structured objects – the framework can summarize large blobs later.
- Throw informative errors for recoverable vs fatal failures.

## 4. Planning helpers

When `useTodoList: true`, the smart agent injects:
- `manage_todo_list` – CRUD the structured plan (must keep exactly one item `in-progress`).
- Planning system prompt block with strict rules (plan first, update after every action, never reveal plan text).

`plan` events fire whenever the TODO list is written, carrying the latest list and version.

## 5. Structured output finalize

Provide `outputSchema` (Zod). The framework:
- Adds a hidden `response` tool instructing the model to call it exactly once with the final JSON.
- Stores the parsed result in `state.ctx.__structuredOutputParsed` and surfaces it via `result.output`.
- Falls back to attempting to parse JSON from the final assistant message if the model skips the finalize tool.

## 6. Multi-agent composition
- `agent.asTool({ toolName })` wraps an agent so another agent can delegate to it like any other tool.
- `agent.asHandoff()` creates a handoff descriptor; when invoked, the runtime switches to the target agent until it returns a final answer.

## 7. Limits

`SmartAgentLimits` control throughput and summarization:
- `maxToolCalls` – total tool executions allowed per invocation.
- `maxParallelTools` – concurrent tool executions per agent turn.
- `maxToken` – token threshold before the next model call; exceeding it triggers `contextSummarize`.
- `contextTokenLimit` – target token budget for the live transcript.
- `summaryTokenLimit` – target size of each generated summary (per chunk).

## 8. Summarization lifecycle
1. Estimate token usage using `countApproxTokens` (~4 chars per token).
2. When over budget, chunk the transcript (keeping tool-call groups together).
3. Ask the model to summarize each chunk; iteratively merge partials.
4. Replace tool responses in `messages` with `SUMMARIZED executionId:'...'` markers.
5. Move originals to `toolHistoryArchived` so `get_tool_response` can fetch them later.
6. Emit a `summarization` event with the merged summary and archive count.

## 9. Events & observability

`onEvent` (global or per-invoke) surfaces:
- `tool_call` lifecycle events (start/success/error/skipped).
- `plan` write/read events from `manage_todo_list`.
- `summarization` notifications when context is compacted.
- `metadata` with model name, limits, and normalized usage per turn.
- `handoff` announcements when control switches to another runtime.
- `finalAnswer` with the final assistant content.

Enable `debug.enabled` to persist Markdown transcripts under `logs/<timestamp>/` or provide `debug.callback` to intercept logs programmatically.

## 10. Usage tracking

Each assistant turn can contribute provider usage (if available). `normalizeUsage` maps the raw provider object into a consistent shape. Aggregated totals are stored in `state.usage.totals[modelName]` and emitted in `metadata` events.
