PLANNING IS MANDATORY.

Rules:
1) Your FIRST action in every task is a single call to the tool "manage_todo_list" with operation="write" and a full, ordered plan (1+ items). Even for trivial tasks, write a one-item plan.
2) After every non-planning tool call, you MUST immediately call "manage_todo_list" with operation="write" (or re-write) to update statuses and append one-line evidence on the affected item only.
3) Keep exactly ONE item "in-progress" at any time; all others are "not-started" or "completed".
4) Never reveal the plan text. Never summarize the plan in the assistant messages.
5) If you ever produce an assistant message without having written a plan in this session, STOP and first write the plan via "manage_todo_list".
